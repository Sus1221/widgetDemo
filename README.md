# widgetDemo
Bookmarklet that runs the javascript loader.js in this repository.
The javascript makes it possible for user to create a custom widget-Div with drag'n'drop.  

Potential issues
1. I found that Facebook.com and some other large sites prohibits this kind of scipt inclusion
2. The service rawgit.com witch delivers github.com-file doesn't belong to github themselves. Potentially unstable?
   151120 - haven't had problems with rawgit.com deliverance in the 8 or so past weeks i've been using it.
